          The potato is a starchy food. Potatoes are a common source of
          carbohydrates in many diets and are known for their high starch
          content. When potatoes are cooked, the starch granules in the cells of
          the potato swell and absorb water, making the potato soft and fluffy.
          <br><br>
          This starchy quality makes potatoes a versatile ingredient in many
          dishes and cuisines around the world. However, it's worth noting that
          potatoes also contain other nutrients such as vitamin C, potassium,
          and fiber, which can provide health benefits when consumed as part of
          a balanced diet.
